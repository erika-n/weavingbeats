Weaving beats: a fractal music thingum.

Make fractal beats out of another song or sound. 

This is an example of the algorithm I use to make music out of fractals, a simplified but clean version that should be good for getting started experimenting. 


Usage:

Edit fractal parameters in transformations.py

python weaving_beats.py

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SECONDS, --seconds SECONDS
                        seconds of music
  -i INPUTFILE, --inputfile INPUTFILE
                        input file (.wav)
  -o OUTPUTFILENAME, --outputfilename OUTPUTFILENAME
                        output filename (don't add extension
  -d DEPTH, --depth DEPTH
                        fractal recursion depth (level of detail)
